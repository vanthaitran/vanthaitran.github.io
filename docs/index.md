# Van Thai Tran

I work at the intersection of robotics and additive manufacturing, focusing on robotic
systems, sensing, and control methods for precise fabrication, inspection, and repair
in real-world environments.

## Research interests
- Robotics for additive manufacturing and in-situ fabrication
- Mobile and legged robotic systems
- Perception, calibration, and pose estimation
- Motion planning, kinematics, and repeatability analysis
- Process monitoring and quality evaluation
