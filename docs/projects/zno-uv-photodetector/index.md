# All-Inkjet-Printed Flexible ZnO UV Photodetector

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fully inkjet-printed, micro-sized flexible ultraviolet (UV) photodetector based on zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films. Both the semiconductor layer and metallic electrodes are fabricated using inkjet printing, enabling a fully additive, maskless, and digitally controlled process compatible with flexible substrates. The device is designed for wearable UV monitoring and flexible optoelectronic applications.

## Problem & Motivation
- Conventional UV photodetectors rely on vacuum-based deposition and photolithography, which are costly and poorly suited for flexible substrates.
- Flexible and wearable UV sensors require low-temperature, scalable, and patternable fabrication methods.
- Fully printed inorganic semiconductor devices remain challenging due to film uniformity, crystallinity, and electrical performance constraints.

## Key Contributions
1. Demonstration of a **fully inkjet-printed ZnO UV photodetector**, including both ZnO semiconductor and silver electrodes.
2. Development of a **solution-based ZnO printing and thermal conversion process** compatible with flexible Kapton substrates.
3. Experimental validation of **fast photoresponse, high on/off ratio, and mechanical flexibility**.
